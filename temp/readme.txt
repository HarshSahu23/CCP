The following repository consists all the programs written during the
PLA1003 - Competitve Coding Practices Class at VIT Bhopal University.

Note - Programs written since 09-June make use of Helper Code. Make sure
to download those helper files as well to run other files smoothly.

Summary of helper codes : 
  a) PrintMatrix.java    = main function → printMatrix(int[][] matrix) 
                           accepts a 2D array & prints them in a formatted manner
                           
  b) GenerateMatrix.java = main function → generateMatrix(int row, int column, boolean display,int bound) 
                           row → determines the number of rows in matrix
                           column → determines the number of columns in matrix
                           display → determines whether to display the generated matrix or not
                           bound → set the max value to be inserted into the matrix
